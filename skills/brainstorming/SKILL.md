# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit
6. **Spec self-review** — check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope
7. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
8. **Transition to implementation** — invoke writing-plans skill to create implementation plan

## Process Flow

```
Explore context
  → Ask clarifying questions (one at a time)
  → Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
  → Present design in sections, get approval after each
  → User approves? yes → Write design doc
                   no  → Revise
  → Spec self-review (fix inline)
  → User reviews spec? approved → Invoke writing-plans skill
                      changes  → Revise and repeat
```

**The terminal state is invoking writing-plans.** The ONLY skill you invoke after brainstorming is writing-plans.

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems, flag this immediately and help decompose into sub-projects
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible
- Only one question per message
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Present design in sections; ask after each section whether it looks right
- Scale each section to complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units: one clear purpose, well-defined interfaces, testable independently
- For each unit: what does it do, how do you use it, what does it depend on?

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Include targeted improvements only where they directly serve the current goal.
- Don't propose unrelated refactoring.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- Write the validated design (spec) to `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
  - (User preferences for spec location override this default)
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, check:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do sections contradict each other?
3. **Scope check:** Focused enough for a single implementation plan?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two ways? Pick one and make it explicit.

Fix issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**User Review Gate:**

> "Spec written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want any changes before we start writing the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. Only proceed once approved.

**Implementation:**

- Invoke the writing-plans skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- Do NOT invoke any other skill. writing-plans is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** — Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** — Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** — Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** — Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** — Present design, get approval before moving on
